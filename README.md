# Aquami3D
Quantifies the 3D microstructure of nanoporous, bicontinuous or foam structures.

<br> 
Extends some of the measurements from the original AQUAMI code to allow 3D input data including tiff stacks and OVITO XYZ files. Measures ligament diameter and length.  Unfortunately I never got around to publishing a paper for this, but you can check out the original [AQUAMI paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.08.012) <br> <br>
